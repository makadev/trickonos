  This is for extension Tests.
   non-core features or mostly autonomous features, 
   where related core features are already tested
  
  This should reduce the (growing) amount of tests for the core parts and
  mostly test extensions like type methods, subsystems, internal objects and
  so on which are not used by core or core tests
