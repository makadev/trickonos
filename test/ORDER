 
 First Compile Tests, that should test wether
   macros/stats/exprs are compilable.
 
 Second Core Tests. They test core Macros that should
  halt/abort the machine, Basic Control Flow and 
  several things used in further testing (e.g. typechecking,
  early checks done in vm rather then on script objects).
  (create both fail/success tests)
 
 Third Oper0 Tests. They test basic Operations (Script Object
 stuff) on level0 types nil/bool/int/list/dict ..
 
 Fourth Internals Tests. Non basic internal checks, calls and so on.
 Also Extended Objects.
 
 Last but not Least, the Macro Tests for added Macros.
