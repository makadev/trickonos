# Introduction #

As of 2013, Trickonos stands for both an Interpreter and an Engine.

**Trickonos Engine (TE)** is a - _high level_, _object-oriented_ , multi purpose - runtime system - which contains a high level machine, byte code compiler, object and low level extension API, garbage collector and object allocator - capable of loading code and executing calls to and in a dynamic runtime environment.

_Simply put it's an HL OO Script Engine with VM and Byte code Compiler._

**Trickonos Processor (TP)** is a general purpose, command line front and back end to the Trickonos Engine.

_Or let's just say, the default Command Line Interpreter._

# Current State and Version #

Trickonos reentered the Modeling and Analysis Phase. It is not on hold, there is just currently nothing half as usable as v0.2a available.

Feel free to use the old code, thought its not recommended due to several bugs and shortcomings not being fixed in the public repository. Also, documentation is not as thorough as it should be.
